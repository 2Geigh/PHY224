Physical model used has to be correct

Put residuals as a subplot of the main figure showing the fit
Fig. 4, 6, 7 -- difference between them?

Prefer single-commumn and single-spaced
Only use math input for equations, not numbers
	Equations must be labelled with a number
Captions should report:
	Fit function
	Best fit parameters + their uncertainties
	Chi-squared

Report uncertainty of best-fit parameters
Results should be reported only to the precision of your uncertainty
Show proper error propagation

How did you record your uncertainties?
Methodology for both parts of activity should be one section
Refer to fig. 1 in your method description
